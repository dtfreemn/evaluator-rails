### Overview
  eVALUEate is an employee review management system for companies to create, execute, and track the data of their internal reviews of their employees. All information is created by the company, which makes the environment flexible for any industry or type of company. Companies add their own teams and their own employees, create their own rubrics, and create their own values on which their employees are assessed. Then, after assessing employees and assigning them action steps, supervisors can see past data on each employee's historical reviews, including individual timeline graphs for any topic on which an employee has ever been rated. Supervisors can also mark action steps as complete or incomplete in order to keep track of their employees' progress on those goals.
